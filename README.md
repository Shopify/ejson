# ejson

`ejson` is a utility for managing a collection of secrets in source control. The
secrets are encrypted using [public
key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), [elliptic
curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) cryptography
([NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) [Box](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html):
[Curve25519](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) +
[Salsa20](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20) +
[Poly1305-AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305-AES)). Secrets are
collected in a JSON file, in which all the string values are encrypted. Public
keys are embedded in the file, and the decrypter looks up the corresponding
private key from its local filesystem.

The main benefits provided by `ejson` are:

* Secrets can be safely stored in a git repo.
* Changes to secrets are auditable on a line-by-line basis with `git blame`.
* Anyone with git commit access has access to write new secrets.
* Decryption access can easily be locked down to production servers only.
* Secrets change synchronously with application source (as opposed to secrets
  provisioned by Configuration Management).
* Simple, well-tested, easily-auditable source.

See [the manpages](https://shopify.github.io/ejson) for more technical documentation.

See [ejson2env](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson2env) for a useful tool to help with exporting
a portion of secrets as environment variables for environments/tools that require this pattern.

## Installation

You can download the `.deb` package from [Github Releases](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson/releases).

On development machines (64-bit linux or OS X), the recommended installation
method is via Homebrew:

```
brew install ejson
```

## Workflow

### 1: Create the Keydir

By default, EJSON looks for keys in `/opt/ejson/keys`. You can change this by
setting `EJSON_KEYDIR` or passing the `-keydir` option.

```
$ mkdir -p /opt/ejson/keys
```

### 2: Generate a keypair

When called with `-w`, `ejson keygen` will write the keypair into the `keydir`
and print the public key. Without `-w`, it will print both keys to stdout. This
is useful if you have to distribute the key to multiple servers via
configuration management, etc.

```
$ ejson keygen
Public Key:
63ccf05a9492e68e12eeb1c705888aebdcc0080af7e594fc402beb24cce9d14f
Private Key:
75b80b4a693156eb435f4ed2fe397e583f461f09fd99ec2bd1bdef0a56cf6e64
```

```
$ ejson keygen -w
53393332c6c7c474af603c078f5696c8fe16677a09a711bba299a6c1c1676a59
$ cat /opt/ejson/keys/5339*
888a4291bef9135729357b8c70e5a62b0bbe104a679d829cdbe56d46a4481aaf
```

### 3: Create an `ejson` file

The format is described in more detail [later on](#format). For now, create a
file that looks something like this. Fill in the `<key>` with whatever you got
back in step 2.

Create this file as `test.ejson`:

```json
{
  "_public_key": "<key>",
  "database_password": "1234password"
}
```

### 4: Encrypt the file

Running `ejson encrypt test.ejson` will encrypt any new plaintext keys in the
file, and leave any existing encrypted keys untouched:

```json
{
  "_public_key": "63ccf05a9492e68e12eeb1c705888aebdcc0080af7e594fc402beb24cce9d14f",
  "database_password": "EJ[1:WGj2t4znULHT1IRveMEdvvNXqZzNBNMsJ5iZVy6Dvxs=:kA6ekF8ViYR5ZLeSmMXWsdLfWr7wn9qS:fcHQtdt6nqcNOXa97/M278RX6w==]"
}
```

Try adding another plaintext secret to the file and run `ejson encrypt
test.ejson` again. The `database_password` field will not be changed, but the
new secret will be encrypted.

### 5: Decrypt the file

To decrypt the file, you must have a file present in the `keydir` whose name is
the 64-byte hex-encoded public key exactly as embedded in the `ejson` document.
The contents of that file must be the similarly-encoded private key. If you used
`ejson keygen -w`, you've already got this covered.

Unlike `ejson encrypt`, which overwrites the specified files, `ejson decrypt`
only takes one file parameter, and prints the output to `stdout`:

```
$ ejson decrypt foo.ejson
{
  "_public_key": "63ccf05a9492e68e12eeb1c705888aebdcc0080af7e594fc402beb24cce9d14f",
  "database_password": "1234password"
}
```

## Format

The `ejson` document format is simple, but there are a few points to be aware
of:

1. It's just JSON.
2. There *must* be a key at the top level named `_public_key`, whose value is a
   32-byte hex-encoded (i.e. 64 ASCII byte) public key as generated by `ejson
   keygen`.
3. Any string literal that isn't an object key will be encrypted by default (ie.
   in `{"a": "b"}`, `"b"` will be encrypted, but `"a"` will not.
4. Numbers, booleans, and nulls aren't encrypted.
5. If a key begins with an underscore, its corresponding value will not be
   encrypted. This is used to prevent the `_public_key` field from being
   encrypted, and is useful for implementing metadata schemes.
6. Underscores do not propagate downward. For example, in `{"_a": {"b": "c"}}`,
   `"c"` will be encrypted.
