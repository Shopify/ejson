# EJSON

EJSON is a small library to manage encrypted secrets using PKCS7 (asymmetric)
encryption. It provides a simple command interface to manage and update secrets
in a JSON file where keys are cleartext and values are encrypted.

## Installation

It's on rubygems. Just `gem install ejson` or add it to your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

#### 1) Create a `secrets.ejson`:

    echo '{"a": "b"}' > config/secrets.production.ejson

Keys in this file will remain in cleartext, while values will all be encrypted.
It can be arbitrarily nested.

Any values having keys beginning with underscores will be left unencrypted. e.g.:

```json
{
  "some_secret": "ENC[MII.....]",
  "_a_comment": "you can change this at http://foo.bar"
}
```

#### 2) Encrypt the file:

    ejson

This updates `config/secrets.ejson` in place, encrypting any newly-added or
modified values that are not yet encrypted. `ejson` is short-hand for `ejson encrypt`.

By default, it uses a public key that you won't be able to decrypt (and
shouldn't use because we *can* decrypt it!). You can use your own by following
the "Custom keypair" directions below. Feel free to fork the gem to reference
your own keypair by default.

#### 3) Decrypt the file:

     ejson decrypt -k ~/.keys/ejson.priv.pem -p config/ejson.pub.pem secrets.production.ejson > secrets.production.json

Unlike encrypt, decrypt doesn't update the file in-place; it prints the
decrypted contents to stdout. It also requires access to the private key
created in step 1.

#### See `ejson help` for more information.

## Custom keypair:

We use a single keypair internally; the default public key is fetched from S3
on each run. However, you can generate your own keypair like so:

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 100000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out publickey.pem -subj '/'

`publickey.pem` and `privatekey.pem` are created. Move `privatekey.pem`
somewhere more private, and move `publickey.pem` somewhere more public.

Then you can encrypt like:

    ejson encrypt -p publickey.pem secrets.ejson

If you'd like to fork the gem to reference your own public key, that
information lives around line 10 of `lib/ejson/cli.rb`.
